# Site todos: 

* Change email icon to email.png on same line as H2 and H3. Float right. 
* Limit table width to 95% of the page. These started blowing off the right side of the page recently. 
* Create way to use wrapped images. Tried a parent div with two child divs but there are issues with float. Try not to use float: 

:: 

    div.twocol { width:800px; background-color:gray}

    div.leftcolumn {
      width: 100%;
      float:left;
    }

    div.rightcolumn {
      float:left;
      padding: 20px 20px 20px 100px;
    }
