Top considerations
==========================


Manufacturers
================================

Mating with a prop
============================

Criteria: 

#. one
#. two
#. three


The `e-props folks <https://ppg.e-props.fr/index.php?cPath=1>`_ match multiple props to each specific motor. It's worth checking out to get an idea of acceptable combinations.


Duty cycle-Max continuous power
===============================


There is also a suggestion that the lower the no load kv value of the motor the greater the 100% duty cycle reduction factor. Probably useful to know if one of the larger diameter 35kv or 27kv motors marketed for use on paramotors is being considered.

KV reduction
