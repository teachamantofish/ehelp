Battery considerations 
==========================

Type
---------------

LiPO examples: 

* Premium: `Tattu, Tattuplus (smart batteries) <https://www.genstattu.com/6s-22-2-v-lipo-battery.html?sort=pricedesc>`_, Bonkas (see OpenPPG)
* DIY build your own: A pia but 1/2 the cost.
* Budget batteries: zee? yawoo? don't go to low. 
  

LiPO graphene

* Some advantages, but not weight

Semi solid state:

* The technology is rapidly evolving. Manufacture claims a higher energy density, lighter weight, higher discharge rates, and a longer cycle life. 
* Details here: https://www.foxtechfpv.com/foxtech-diamond-6s-22000mah-semi-solid-state-li-ion-battery.html
* A 7s 1kw Foxtech setup is around 3 lbs lighter than a Tattu 6s Lipo setup.

.. note:: It's worth reading this `forum snippet <./resources/batterycomparison.pdf>`_ as well as the entire `thread here <https://community.openppg.com/t/new-battery-option-better-power-density/2274/42>`_.

Size
--------------

Your flying consumes kilowatt hours: Kwh = volts X amps. For example, two 6s (22.2 volts) 22000mAH batteries will = about 1 Kw. How much and what kind of flying you can do with 1 Kwh can't be known until you've gone through the steps in :ref:`spec`.

Price
------------------

Cheap batteries can kill you, have short lifespans, or perform poorly. Be careful.
