==================

* **'S' Rating (e.g. 10S, 12S, etc.)**: The number in front of the “S” rating is the number of cells.  For example, a “5S”  battery is a 5 cell battery which is 18.5 volts (5 cells x 3.7 volts = 18.5 volts). 

* **mAH**: The mAh stands for milliamp hours. For example a 2000 mAh battery would take an hour to discharge if it had a 2000 ma load on it. If you put a 1000 mA load on that same battery it will take 2 hours to discharge. Conversely if you have a drone that requires 15 amps (15,000 mA) the same battery would be discharged in roughly 8 minutes (2000 / 15000 = .13 hours = 8 minutes).

* **'C'**: The Crating, or discharge, indicates how fast the ions flow from the anode to the cathode. The “C” rating and cost are directionally propionate to one another. Many people decide which battery to buy based solely on the ‘C’ rating, however more should be taken into account.The “C” rate is the multiplier at which it can safely be discharged. For example, a 10C 2000 mAh battery will safely discharge at 20,000 mA or 20 amps (10 X 2000 = 20,000 mA = 20 amp).  A 60C 2000 mAh battery will safely discharge 120,000 mA or 120 amps (60 X 2000 = 120,000 mA = 120 amp). If you try to pull too much amperage from a lower rated battery you can cause it to overheat and damage the battery.
