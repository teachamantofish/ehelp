tbd: Is this correct?: find the prop/RPM combination that will give you both the thrust and efficiency you want, then work backwards from there to determine how much motor power is required and what motor KV/battery voltage you want to use. Then source the motor and controller.


As a rough guideline look for a motor/battery configuration that has a no-load RPM that is 125% of your target full-throttle RPM. 

what percent of continuous power to use for a 5 minute climb?
