Navigating to final choices and a working system is difficult and time consuming. Until the eHelp harness idea is more widespread, advice will be scattered and design principles scattered across various Facebook pages and forums with pioneers helping where they can. With luck, the concepts here will gain enough traction that the hang gliding community can emulate what's happening with `OpenPPG <https://openppg.com/>`_ 

Until then, moving forward is a bit of work. 

Decision path
=====================



Determine what you need
==================================



Method 1: Copy others
==========================



Method 2: Do the math
==============================


Notes, todo, not reviewed
=================================

tbd: Is this correct?: find the prop/RPM combination that will give you both the thrust and efficiency you want, then work backwards from there to determine how much motor power is required and what motor KV/battery voltage you want to use. Then source the motor and controller.


As a rough guideline look for a motor/battery configuration that has a no-load RPM that is 125% of your target full-throttle RPM. 

what percent of continuous power to use for a 5 minute climb?
