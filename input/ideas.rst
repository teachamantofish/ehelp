Ideas and Experiments

This document does not include trikes, ultralights, and paramotors. However, interesting rigs with unique or related ideas may appear here. Please forward any videos you find inspiring. 

Prone launch configurations
================================

The reason I include these here is because prone launching removes the need to control a throttle and glider during a running launch. There's no immediate altitude with a flat land launch so simplicity has its advantages.
