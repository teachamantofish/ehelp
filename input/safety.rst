Design Checklist
===================================

.. note:: todo: Battery power: mgm and hacker naturally also have esc for up to 120 volts. but only for professional applications. the 60 V regulation applies to diy e-bikes, e-karts, rc models, etc. Imagine building a 24 S battery. as soon as you touch both + / - once you are definitely dead with a battery that can deliver the impulse regardless of whether 12 S or up to 24 s up to 6000 amps. the body can cope with up to 60 V. from 18 S you get muscle cramps. from 22 S it becomes fatal at dc. take a look at a welding machine that produces the arc at full power at mostly 20 volts and 250 amps. imagine 20 times that going through your body through the heart. the heart is a sensitive muscle â€¦

Battery
==========================

Main power switch
---------------------

Quick disconnect
---------------------

Status monitor
---------------------

Temperature monitor and/or alarm
------------------------------------------

TBD
---------------------




Mechanical
=============================

* Boom length
* Prop clearances
* Motor mounts

Glider handling
====================================

* CG
* Center of mass
* Glider pitch stability: Thrust line

Turbulence sensors
------------------------

Some ideas from Charles Allen: 

* Pitch and roll shutoff: IMU which could be wired up to shut motors if Pitch or Roll exceeds x angle. 
* Preasure sensor on the carabiner to measure when weight is off and shut motors.
