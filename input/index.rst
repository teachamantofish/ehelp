Why ehelp? Because for 2000-3000 bucks a DIYer can build a 20 pound eHelp harness and flatland foot launch. No mountain. No towing. No modified glider. No tow rig.  The time and $$$ investment quickly pays for itself through reduced driving to launches, hang-waiting, tow costs, alcoholic consumption while jonesing for some airtime. Only the pilot can determine the ultimate payback.

The systems are relatively simple, and energetic pioneers are paving the way with open source plans and Youtube videos. The multi-billion dollar drone, battery, and EV industries are quickly driving the evolution of cheaper, lighter, and more powerful components.  

In a few years, we'll like have lighter and more powerful motors (axial), smaller and safer batteries (solid state, and (with luck) commercial ready-to-fly choices, kits, manuals, and parts.

Goals
==========================

* **Support DIY development**: Concise details on existing projects should engage the community, increase participation, speed new approaches, and improve safety. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, but there is a need to improve the wheel and invent some wheel alternatives.
* **Advance the technology**: Easily accessible information should speed and foster the development and use of functional designs.
* **Encourage growth in the sport of hang gliding**: The decline of hang gliding is well-known. Perhaps the ability to flatland launch with a simple DIY system will invigorate the sport.
