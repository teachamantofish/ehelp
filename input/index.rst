What is an eHelp harness? 
===============================

tbd

* Simple, diy, 1500-3500 bucks, launch anywhere, climb and find a thermal or sustainer. 
* Do not have to learn new launch techniques.
* Investment quickly pays for itself since it reduces driving to launches, hang-waiting, tow costs,

Goals
==========================

* **Support DIY development**: Concise details on existing projects should engage the community, increase participation, speed new approaches, and improve safety. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, but there is a need to improve the wheel.
* **Advance the technology**: Easily accessible information should speed and foster the development and use of functional designs.
* **Encourage growth in the sport of hang gliding**: The decline of hang gliding is well known. Perhaps the ability to flatland launch with a simple DIY system will invigorate the sport.
