Why? Because for 1500-2500 bucks a DIYer can build a 20 pound eHelp harness and flatland foot launch from any location. No modified glider. No tow rig. Minimal learning curve.  The time and $$$ investment quickly pays for itself since it reduces driving to launches, hang-waiting, tow costs, alcoholic consumption while jonesing for some airtime.

The systems are relatively simple, and energetic pioneers are paving the way with open source plans and Youtube videos. A multi-billion dollar drone industry (and others) are quickly driving the evolution of cheaper, lighter, and more powerful components.

Goals
==========================

* **Support DIY development**: Concise details on existing projects should engage the community, increase participation, speed new approaches, and improve safety. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, but there is a need to improve the wheel.
* **Advance the technology**: Easily accessible information should speed and foster the development and use of functional designs.
* **Encourage growth in the sport of hang gliding**: The decline of hang gliding is well known. Perhaps the ability to flatland launch with a simple DIY system will invigorate the sport. 

Contribute
