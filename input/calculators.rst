Motor
============

Motor efficiency: Used power - heat. Heat is P=i squared * amps (resistance squared times amps)


-Power P=M*n/9.55 means that you need 47Nm torque@3000rpm for 15kW output. kV 50 means youâ€™ll need at least 246A output at 60v to get this torque.

Propeller
==========================

Prop pitch
-----------------------------

`Prop pitch recommendation (for cruise?) <http://www.culverprops.com/pitchselection.htm>`_ based on RPM, airspeed, and prop length. You can also view the `tables <http://www.culverprops.com/viewpitchtable.htm>`_

Theoretical speed
---------------------------

See https://www.warpdriveprops.com/propspd2.html

To determine how fast your propeller can theoretically push or pull you through the air at a given rpm and pitch, multiply your propeller's pitch in inches (usually measured at 75 percent of the prop disk radius) times the RPM. Then multiply that figure times .000947 which gives you your speed in miles per hour. Then multiply this figure by .85 if your aircraft is reasonably aerodynamically clean or by .80 or .75 if your aircraft is somewhat "draggy". This last operation compensates for propeller slippage and some aircraft drag. The end result should be a reasonably accurate estimate of your aircraft's airspeed potential. Use this process to help determine the amount of propeller pitch you need for your particular aircraft. Use the Theoretical Speed Calculator below.

Tip speed
---------------

Tip speed
--------------------------

Propeller efficiency reduces as the tip speed approaches the speed of sound.  Beyond 80% of the speed of sound, increasing RPM has 
little affect on thrust. Ideally, keep tip speeds below 75%-80% of Mach. 

Optimum efficiency and less noise stems from tip speeds less than 700 feet per second or 475 mph. Over that, and air compression in front of the prop leading edge begins occuring which rapidly degrades propeller performance.
